Quinn-Mccluskey Algortihm for Logic gates
I did this project for a logic circuit lesson.
In this project we will include input elements and Dont'Cares.
And outputs include:
1-Classification of Elements by number of binary numbers
2-First step of constructing PIs 
3-Extraction of EPIs 
And finally the final answer which is based on ABCD classification.
